<h1> Friendship </h1>
<p>  Friendship is one of the greatest bonds anyone can ever wish for.<br>
     Lucky are those who have friends they can trust.<br>
      Friendship is a devoted relationship between two individuals.<br>
       They both feel immense care and love for each other.<br>
       Usually, a friendship is shared by two people who have similar interests and feelings.<br>
       You meet many along the way of life but only some stay with you forever.<br>
        Those are your real friends who stay by your side through thick and thin. <br>
        Friendship is the most beautiful gift you can present to anyone.<br>
         It is one which stays with a person forever.</p>

         <h1>True friends</h1>
<p>A person is acquainted with many persons in their life. However, the closest ones become our friends.<br>
     You may have a large friend circle in school or college,<br>
      but you know you can only count on one or two people with whom you share true friendship.<br>
    There are essentially two types of friends, one is good friends the other are true friends or best friends.<br>
     They’re the ones with whom we have a special bond of love and affection.,<br>
      In other words, having a true friend makes our lives easier and full of happiness.<br>
      Most importantly, true friendship stands for a relationship free of any judgments.<br>
       In a true friendship, a person can be themselves completely without the fear of being judged.<br>
        It makes you feel loved and accepted. This kind of freedom is what every human strives to have in their lives.<br>
      In short, true friendship is what gives us reason to stay strong in life.,<br>
       Having a loving family and all is okay but you also need true friendship to be completely happy.<br>
        Some people don’t even have families but they have friends who’re like their family only. <br>
        Thus, we see having true friends means a lot to everyone.<br></p>

        <h1>Importance of Friendship</h1>
        <p>Friendship is important in life because it teaches us a great deal about life.<br>
            We learn so many lessons from friendship which we won’t find anywhere else.<br>
             You learn to love someone other than your family.<br>
              You know how to be yourself in front of friends.<br>
            Friendship never leaves us in bad times.<br>
             You learn how to understand people and trust others.<br>
              Your real friends will always motivate you and cheer for you.<br>
               They will take you on the right path and save you from any evil.<br>
            
            Similarly, friendship also teaches you a lot about loyalty.<br>
             It helps us to become loyal and get loyalty in return.<br>
              There is no greater feeling in the world than having a friend who is loyal to you.<br>
            
            Moreover, friendship makes us stronger. It tests us and helps us grow.<br>
             For instance, we see how we fight with our friends yet come back together after setting aside our differences.<br>
              This is what makes us strong and teaches us patience.<br>
            
            Therefore, there is no doubt that best friends help us in our difficulties and bad times of life.<br>
             They always try to save us in our dangers as well as offer timely advice.<br>
              True friends are like the best assets of our life because they share our sorrow,<br> 
              sooth our pain and make us feel happy.</p>
